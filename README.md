Amazon Machine Learning Scientist | Day 1

Hey Guys, 
Time for me to start with the new course. Currently i am following the Amazon's Machine Learning Scientist Course from AWS Educate. Here is what all I learnt today: <br/>
Day 1:<br/>
ML Models are divided into 3 parts:<br/>
a) Supervised Learning (Making a Prediction)- Predict future outcomes with help of training from historic data.<br/>
b) Unsupervised Learning (Finding a hidden pattern) - Finding out the hidden patterns without giving any external input apart from the raw data<br/>
c) Reinforcement Learning (Decision Making based on past rewards)- Takes decision based on the past rewards for its actions<br/>

Supervised Learning: <br/>
a. Used to predict future outcomes based on the historic data. g Spam mail detection.<br/>
b. An example could be Email Spam Filtration<br/>
c. Machine works based on series of Question and Answer format, while analyzing historic data.<br/>

Unsupervised Learning:<br/>
a. An example would be Face Recognition; like friend photo suggestion in Facebook whence uploading any photo.<br/>
b. It works by finding out Patterns, Similarities or anomalies in data.<br/>
c. It works on observations and is able to find Structures and Relationships among input data.<br/>
d. Talking about Facebook, when a photo is uploaded, it matches the Face and Features of the Friends in your list and suggests friends which can be tagged.<br/>
e. Netflix, Amazon and e-commerce websites use the same method for segregation of items.<br/>
Reinforcement Learning: <br/>
a. Takes decision based on the past rewards for its actions<br/>
b. Usually it is used to increase the efficiency of tool / program
There are 3 stages involved namely: 
i. Decision <br/>
ii. Feedback<br/>
iii. Learning<br/>
e.g. In chess, the machine suggests a move (DECISION). It gets to know whether the decision was good/bad one (FEEDBACK). Learns from the feedback and takes the same as input for next iteration.<br/>

ML Algorithms:
There are several algorithms for Machine Learning out there. However, most of them can be categorized as:<br/>
1. Supervised : Classification and Regression<br/>
2. Unsupervised : Clustering and Association<br/>

Classification Algorithms: <br/>
a. Yes/ No Prediction | 0/1 solution or output; these algorithms give a generic output which is in binary format.<br/>
b. IT is generally used to classify something into a given class<br/>
e.g. Spam filtering:<br/>
- Samples of Spam and Not Spam mails are fed to machine. <br/>
- It analyzes the mails, finds out the words like lottery etc. and also the ones which have been flagged by the user. Now, system learns from it.<br/>
- Whenever a new mail comes in, it is able to separate them as Spam or Not Spam (Categorical Seperation)<br/>
- Naive Bayes algorithm is one such algorithm<br/>

Regression Algorithm:<br/>
a. Such algorithms are used to Predict a value based on past data.<br/>
b. Difference is that , we are trying to Predict a VALUE ,whereas in the classification algorithms, we just segregate (separate) data; which is binary.<br/>
c. In Regression, relation is created between different variables. i.e. Multiple variables are used (combined) to analyze and produce the output<br/>
e.g. Temperature, wind and humidity : predicts whether rain will happen or not.<br/>
Remember, output of regression is always Quantitative in nature, mostly based on the past data.<br/>

Clustering Algorithm:<br/>
 a. Algorithm where a set of observations are divided into a subset, known as clusters.
 b. Information inside these clusters are similar to each other and are decided based on some parameters.<br/>
 c. used in E-shopping, healthcare and Financial Services<br/>
 Classification and Regression have some prior knowledge, but in Clustering,all the knowledge is available from clusters only.
 e.g. Network Provider : Tower range, local geography and population data are given to system and it learns from it. Further it provides optimal locations for maximum connectivity
 d. K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm which clusters data into K Clusters<br/>
 
Association Algorithm:<br/>
a. identify patters of association between different variables and items.<br/>
b. Market Basket analysis<br/>
e.g. if you buy a set of books, systems learns and suggests similar kind of books next time you want to buy a book. <br/>
e.g. Similarly, in pharma, whenever a new drug is rolled out, prior to that, it is tested against which type of DNA it is sensitive to.<br/>

So, above were my notes for the day 1 of my course. Do you have anything to add, please do share them with me.<br/><br/>
See you tomorrow!<br/>
Happy Learning!<br/>
